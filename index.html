      <p>In June of this year, I took a trip to Montego Bay, Jamaica, with 11 of my closest friends. We went there to celebrate another friend's 31st birthday. Originally, the trip was planned for June 2020, but Covid-19 had other plans.</p>

      <h3>Villa</h3>

      <!--paragraph about the villa-->
      <p id="testP">We stayed at the Golden Castle villa in Rose Hall, a plantation in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The villa accomadated 16 guests and came with 12 bedrooms, in additon to a home theater, game room and fitness, spa and sauna facilities. Included in our stay were a butler, chef, wait staff, gardner, etc.  </p>

      <h3>Private Sailing</h3>

      <!--paragraph about first activity-->
      <p class="funParagraph">One of my favorite memories from this trip was the private sailing. Because my friends like coordinated looks on trips, we had a neon swimwear theme on the boat. We laughed and sipped countless bottles of champagne, while sailing the Caribbean Sea. The boat attendants danced with us and served us more drinks, then served us jerk chicken. It was amazing!</p>

      <h3>ATVs</h3> 
      
      <!--ATVs-->
      <p>I was so excited to ride ATVs, until I actually got to ride one; I didn't enjoy it. Everyone else seemed to be having a blast, while I was struggling to control the ATV! To make matters worse, my ATV stopped working and my group left me! No one had their cellphones with them, so I had to wait for someone to come by and see me.  </p>

      <h3>Other Things I Did in Jamaica</h3>
      <ul><li>Went to the beach</li>
         <li>Had a pool party at our villa</li>
         <li>Drank way too much rum punch</li>
      </ul>
